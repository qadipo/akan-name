# Your Akan Name

#### Author: *Q Adipo*


## Description
This project is meant to give you your first name if you would have been born in the **Akan community** using your birthday.

In the Akan Community in Ghana children are given the first name based on the day in which they are born. This happens for both genders. For example if one is Male, the first name would be as follows:

- Sunday: Kwasi
- Monday: Kwadwo
- Tuesday: Kwabena
- Wednesday: Kwaku
- Thursday:  Yaw
- Friday: Kofi
- Saturday: Kwame

And if one is female, the name would be:

- Sunday: Akosua
- Monday: Adwoa
- Tuesday: Abenaa
- Wednesday: Akua
- Thursday:  Yaa
- Friday: Afua
- Saturday: Ama

Given the birth date, the program will determine what day of the week you were born, hence **your Akan name**. To find out what your name would be click [here]()

Since *most* people do not know what day of the week they were born, we will use the following formula to determine the same:

    d = ( ( (CC/4) -2*CC-1) + ((5*YY/4) ) + ((26*(MM+1)/10)) + DD ) mod 7

 where;

 *d* - is the day of the week
 *CC* - is the century digits. For example 1989 has CC = 19
 *YY* - is the Year digits (1989 has YY = 89)
 *MM* -  is the Month
 *DD* - is the Day of the month 
 *mod* - is the modulus function ( % )
