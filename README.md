# Your Akan Name

## Description
This project is meant to give you your first name if you would have been born in the Akan community using your birthday.

In the Akan Community in Ghana children are given the first name based on the day in which they are born. This happens for both genders. For example if one is Male, the first name would be as follows:

- Sunday: Kwasi
- Monday: Kwadwo
- Tuesday: Kwabena
- Wednesday: Kwaku
- Thursday:  Yaw
- Friday: Kofi
- Saturday: Kwame

And if one is female, the name would be:

- Sunday: Akosua
- Monday: Adwoa
- Tuesday: Abenaa
- Wednesday: Akua
- Thursday:  Yaa
- Friday: Afua
- Saturday: Ama
